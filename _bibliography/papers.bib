title = {Hyper-dimensional gap finite elements for the enforcement of interfacial constraints},
author = {Giffin, B D},
abstractNote = {In the classical theory of two-body contact, a single shared contact interface is con- sidered between two continuum bodies, and is further discretized as such in the finite element setting. In general, however, the finite element mesh topology of two contacting bodies will be non-conforming at this shared interface, requiring the definition of a preferred or intermediate surface over which integral constraints may be evaluated. The specification of this interface is deemed to be somewhat arbitrary, but in practice the numerical solution of contact problems may exhibit sensitivity to the particular choice of intermediate surface. A further complication concerns the need to establish projective mappings between the discretized finite element sur- faces and the chosen intermediate surface, particularly for the sake of evaluating the contact gap function between pairs of points on each of the two bodies.
In this work, a new methodology for the enforcement of contact constraints in the context of finite element analyses is proposed. The method entails an alternative representation of contact surface integrals by equivalently integrating over the interstitial – albeit degenerate gap volume between two contacting bodies. An auxiliary indicator field is defined on each body, and is used to represent the degenerate interstitial volume as a non-degenerate hyper-dimensional gap volume. Over this domain, the gradient of the continuously interpolated displacement field with respect to the indicator field yields the oriented displacement gap, which may be used in the for- mulation of contact inequality constraints. Discretization of the hyper-dimensional gap volume into conforming finite elements is explored, and is observed to offer several advantages over existing contact discretization methods: the proposed method does not require the computation of geometric intersections or projections; it exploits conventional Gaussian quadrature schemes to integrate the hyper-dimensional gap integrals with a sufficient degree of accuracy; and may be naturally and efficiently extended to represent contact between higher-order surfaces. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated on several benchmark problems. Continuing and future work is also discussed, with a focus on intended applications and extensions of the method.},

title = {Model-Based Uncertainty in Predicting Damage to Near-Fault Reinforced Concrete Structures},
author = {Kenawy, M and Giffin, B D},
abstractNote = {Earthquake-induced ground shaking near rupturing faults typically contains strong velocity pulses dictated by the fault rupture characteristics and seismic wave propagation patterns, and can cause significant damage to civil structures compared to ground shaking at locations further away from the fault. Therefore, modeling of the nonlinear, and especially degrading, behavior of near-fault structures with a high degree of fidelity is important for evaluating the structural demands in geographical regions proximate to active faults. Several alternative modeling strategies of varying fidelities exist for representing damage mechanisms in structures under dynamic earthquake loading, but it remains unclear the extent to which the specific choice of modeling strategy affects the estimated risks to near-fault structures. In this study, we examine the bias associated with the predicted seismic demands on near-fault reinforced concrete structures due to deficiencies in the modeling of the degrading behavior of the structural components. We test the use of three different modeling approaches which represent the deterioration of the structural components in different ways: (1) a lumped-plasticity frame model which cumulatively represents several damage mechanisms using nonlinear springs at the ends of the structural components, (2) a conventional distributed-plasticity frame model which represents the deterioration of the concrete and steel materials using uniaxial constitutive models, but is subject to numerical singularities, and (3) a regularized distributed-plasticity frame model recently developed by the authors which utilizes a nonlocal damage technique to overcome artificial strain singularities in representing the deterioration of the concrete and steel materials. We conduct a series of nonlinear dynamic analyses to predict the seismic demands imposed by representative ensembles of near-fault ground motions on structures located between 1 and 15 km away from the fault, and we compare the statistical distributions of the demands associated with each damage modeling approach. The findings of this study highlight the advantages and deficiencies of the different structural modeling strategies in the seismic analysis of degrading systems, and will aid in quantifying the modeling uncertainty associated with performance-based design of near-fault structures.},

abstract = {Abstract Accurate modeling of layered composite structures often requires the use of detailed finite element models which can sufficiently resolve the kinematics and material behavior within each layer of the composite. However, individually discretizing each material layer into finite elements presents a prohibitive computational expensive given the large number of thin layers comprising some laminated composites. To address these challenges, an 8-node layered solid hexahedral finite element is formulated with the aim of striking an appropriate balance between efficiency and fidelity. The element is discretized into an arbitrary number of distinct material layers, and employs reduced in-plane integration within each layer. The chosen reduced integration scheme is supplemented by a novel physical stabilization approach which includes layerwise enhancements to mitigate various forms of locking phenomena. The proposed framework additionally supports the inclusion of interlaminar enhanced displacements to better represent the kinematics of general layered composite materials. The described element formulation has been implemented in the ParaDyn finite element code, and its efficacy for modeling laminated composite structures is demonstrated on a variety of verification problems.},

title = {A smeared crack modeling framework accommodating multi-directional fracture at finite strains},
author = {Giffin, Brian D. and Zywicz, Edward},
annote = {A generic smeared crack modeling framework predicated on the deformation gradient decomposition (DGD) approach is proposed for use in dynamic fracture problems at finite strains, accommodating failure along multiple mutually orthogonal fracture planes embedded within an independently defined bulk material model. Within this constitutive framework, the traction equilibrium conditions imposed at each failure surface are used to determine the associated crack displacements stored as internal state variables. In general, the enforcement of interfacial equilibrium entails the implicit solution of a non-linear system of equations within the constitutive update procedure. However, if inertial effects arising due to the relative motion of the fractured material are incorporated within the model, the traction equilibrium conditions are shown to give rise to corresponding dynamic equations of motion governing the time-evolution of the crack opening displacements. For dynamic problems, an explicit time-integration procedure is devised to efficiently update the material state, subject to a set of internal frictionless contact constraints to prevent material inversion. The efficacy of the proposed modeling framework is investigated through several benchmark dynamic fracture problems run within the explicit finite element code DYNA3D.},

abstract={This work presents a novel polytopal finite-element framework that addresses the collective issues of discretization sensitivity and mesh generation for computational solid mechanics problems. The use of arbitrary polygonal and polyhedral shapes in place of canonical isoparametric elements seeks to remediate issues pertaining to meshing and mesh quality (particularly for irregularly shaped elements), while maintaining many of the desirable features of a traditional finite element method. A general class of partitioned element methods (PEM) is proposed and analyzed, constituting a family of approaches for constructing piecewise polynomial approximations to harmonic shape functions on arbitrary polytopes. Such methods require a geometric partition of each element, and under certain conditions will directly yield integration consistency. Two partitioned element methods are explored in detail, including a novel approach herein referred to as the discontinuous Galerkin partitioned-element method (DG-PEM). An implementational framework for the DG-PEM is presented, along with a discussion of its associated numerical challenges. The numerical precision of the PEM is explored via classical patch tests and single element tests for a representative sampling of polygonal element shapes. Solution sensitivity with respect to element shape is examined for a handful of problems, including a mesh convergence study in the nearly incompressible regime. Finally, the efficacy of the DG-PEM is assessed for a number of benchmark problems involving large deformations and nonlinear material behavior.},
