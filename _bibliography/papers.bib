title = {Shell Element Material Model Verification Problems for DYNA3D: Part II},
author = {Giffin, Brian D.},
abstractNote = {A suite of supplementary shell element material model verification tests were developed for the explicit finite element program DYNA3D, in continuation of the work performed in LLNL-TR-792469 (Shell Element Material Model Verification Problems for DYNA3D). The testing procedure developed in the preceding report is extended, and used to verify all remaining untested shell model features and inputs. A collection of 78 feature-specific verification tests are proposed, some of which are applicable to multiple material models, though many are specialized to a particular model. The collective suite of tests cover all 27 currently available material models in DYNA3D. In the course of developing the proposed test suite, 24 separate shell model-related issues were identified and have subsequently been resolved.},
