title = {Exactly bit-reversible computational methods for memory-efficient adjoint sensitivity analysis of dissipative dynamic systems},
author = {Giffin, Brian Doran},
abstract = {As interest in inverse problems continues to grow across a wide range of disciplines of science and engineering, the size and complexity of inverse problems of practical interest is also increasing. Inverse problems involving time-dependent dynamic systems with a large number of design parameters commonly employ the adjoint state method to compute design parameter sensitivities within a gradient-based optimization framework. For forward analyses entailing a large number of time steps (such as for transient dynamic systems), solution of the adjoint problem may incur excessive memory, I/O, or computational costs which cannot be entirely ameliorated through conventional solution checkpointing schemes, ultimately limiting scalability and efficiency in solving larger problems of emergent interest. To overcome these limitations, a systematic approach is proposed for the development of exactly “bit-reversible” computational methods, enabling prior time states to be rematerialized by reversing the steps of the forward analysis, thereby reducing the additional memory requirements and computational overheads associated with the adjoint state method. Within the proposed framework, a duplicate set of adjoint variables are introduced as ancillary data buffers which continuously accumulate roundoff bits due to finite-precision arithmetic during solution of the forward problem. Upon time-reversal of the forward problem accompanying the solution of the adjoint problem, the roundoff bits are restored to ensure that prior solution states are precisely rematerialized. Utilizing this approach, several foundational bit-reversible algorithms are devised, including a memory-efficient bit-reversible matrix multiplication/inversion algorithm, and exactly bit-reversible explicit time integrators. The developed algorithms are predicated on the use of fixed-precision arithmetic, and are implemented within a proof-of-concept open source library. The computational performance characteristics of the proposed methods are demonstrated through several benchmark problems with intended applications for inverse analysis of dissipative dynamic systems.},

title = {Fragility Analysis of Transmission Towers through Physics-Based Modeling of Tornado-Induced Wind and Debris Impact Loads},
author = {Poudel, Himamshu and Giffin, Brian Doran},
abstract = {Wind-borne debris is a significant contributor to structural damage during high-intensity wind events, but existing methods for estimating debris impact loads on structures are relatively limited. These limitations stem from inherent uncertainties and lack of knowledge regarding the characterization of combined wind and debris loads, as well as a lack of computational modeling strategies for representing wind-borne debris impacts and their effects on structures. In the present study, a physics-based fluid-structure-debris modeling framework coupled with OpenSees is developed to investigate and quantify of the extent to which wind-borne debris impact contributes to structural damage and collapse. Specific focus is placed on assessing the risk of structural collapse of electrical transmission towers subjected to tornadic winds. Within the proposed modeling framework, flying debris is represented through discrete realizations of debris trajectories and impacts, with the nonlinear transient dynamic behavior of the structure of interest modeled using OpenSees. Collisions between debris and the structure are resolved through a penalty-based contact enforcement strategy. A parametric vortex model is used to represent the wind field and to determine wind pressures acting on both the structure and the debris. As a particular application of the proposed methodology, damage and collapse fragility curves were developed for a representative lattice transmission tower using quoFEM, incorporating variability with respect to relevant structural, wind field, and debris loading parameters. The study presents findings which quantitatively compare the estimated risk of collapse when debris impact is included/excluded in the analysis to assess its relative importance.},

title = {Hyper-dimensional gap finite elements for the enforcement of interfacial constraints},
author = {Giffin, Brian Doran},
abstract = {In the classical theory of two-body contact, a single shared contact interface is con- sidered between two continuum bodies, and is further discretized as such in the finite element setting. In general, however, the finite element mesh topology of two contacting bodies will be non-conforming at this shared interface, requiring the definition of a preferred or intermediate surface over which integral constraints may be evaluated. The specification of this interface is deemed to be somewhat arbitrary, but in practice the numerical solution of contact problems may exhibit sensitivity to the particular choice of intermediate surface. A further complication concerns the need to establish projective mappings between the discretized finite element sur- faces and the chosen intermediate surface, particularly for the sake of evaluating the contact gap function between pairs of points on each of the two bodies.
In this work, a new methodology for the enforcement of contact constraints in the context of finite element analyses is proposed. The method entails an alternative representation of contact surface integrals by equivalently integrating over the interstitial – albeit degenerate gap volume between two contacting bodies. An auxiliary indicator field is defined on each body, and is used to represent the degenerate interstitial volume as a non-degenerate hyper-dimensional gap volume. Over this domain, the gradient of the continuously interpolated displacement field with respect to the indicator field yields the oriented displacement gap, which may be used in the for- mulation of contact inequality constraints. Discretization of the hyper-dimensional gap volume into conforming finite elements is explored, and is observed to offer several advantages over existing contact discretization methods: the proposed method does not require the computation of geometric intersections or projections; it exploits conventional Gaussian quadrature schemes to integrate the hyper-dimensional gap integrals with a sufficient degree of accuracy; and may be naturally and efficiently extended to represent contact between higher-order surfaces. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated on several benchmark problems. Continuing and future work is also discussed, with a focus on intended applications and extensions of the method.},

title = {Model-Based Uncertainty in Predicting Damage to Near-Fault Reinforced Concrete Structures},
author = {Kenawy, Maha and Giffin, Brian Doran},
abstract = {Earthquake-induced ground shaking near rupturing faults typically contains strong velocity pulses dictated by the fault rupture characteristics and seismic wave propagation patterns, and can cause significant damage to civil structures compared to ground shaking at locations further away from the fault. Therefore, modeling of the nonlinear, and especially degrading, behavior of near-fault structures with a high degree of fidelity is important for evaluating the structural demands in geographical regions proximate to active faults. Several alternative modeling strategies of varying fidelities exist for representing damage mechanisms in structures under dynamic earthquake loading, but it remains unclear the extent to which the specific choice of modeling strategy affects the estimated risks to near-fault structures. In this study, we examine the bias associated with the predicted seismic demands on near-fault reinforced concrete structures due to deficiencies in the modeling of the degrading behavior of the structural components. We test the use of three different modeling approaches which represent the deterioration of the structural components in different ways: (1) a lumped-plasticity frame model which cumulatively represents several damage mechanisms using nonlinear springs at the ends of the structural components, (2) a conventional distributed-plasticity frame model which represents the deterioration of the concrete and steel materials using uniaxial constitutive models, but is subject to numerical singularities, and (3) a regularized distributed-plasticity frame model recently developed by the authors which utilizes a nonlocal damage technique to overcome artificial strain singularities in representing the deterioration of the concrete and steel materials. We conduct a series of nonlinear dynamic analyses to predict the seismic demands imposed by representative ensembles of near-fault ground motions on structures located between 1 and 15 km away from the fault, and we compare the statistical distributions of the demands associated with each damage modeling approach. The findings of this study highlight the advantages and deficiencies of the different structural modeling strategies in the seismic analysis of degrading systems, and will aid in quantifying the modeling uncertainty associated with performance-based design of near-fault structures.},

abstract = {Abstract Accurate modeling of layered composite structures often requires the use of detailed finite element models which can sufficiently resolve the kinematics and material behavior within each layer of the composite. However, individually discretizing each material layer into finite elements presents a prohibitive computational expensive given the large number of thin layers comprising some laminated composites. To address these challenges, an 8-node layered solid hexahedral finite element is formulated with the aim of striking an appropriate balance between efficiency and fidelity. The element is discretized into an arbitrary number of distinct material layers, and employs reduced in-plane integration within each layer. The chosen reduced integration scheme is supplemented by a novel physical stabilization approach which includes layerwise enhancements to mitigate various forms of locking phenomena. The proposed framework additionally supports the inclusion of interlaminar enhanced displacements to better represent the kinematics of general layered composite materials. The described element formulation has been implemented in the ParaDyn finite element code, and its efficacy for modeling laminated composite structures is demonstrated on a variety of verification problems.},

title = {A smeared crack modeling framework accommodating multi-directional fracture at finite strains},
author = {Giffin, Brian Doran and Zywicz, Edward},
abstract = {A generic smeared crack modeling framework predicated on the deformation gradient decomposition (DGD) approach is proposed for use in dynamic fracture problems at finite strains, accommodating failure along multiple mutually orthogonal fracture planes embedded within an independently defined bulk material model. Within this constitutive framework, the traction equilibrium conditions imposed at each failure surface are used to determine the associated crack displacements stored as internal state variables. In general, the enforcement of interfacial equilibrium entails the implicit solution of a non-linear system of equations within the constitutive update procedure. However, if inertial effects arising due to the relative motion of the fractured material are incorporated within the model, the traction equilibrium conditions are shown to give rise to corresponding dynamic equations of motion governing the time-evolution of the crack opening displacements. For dynamic problems, an explicit time-integration procedure is devised to efficiently update the material state, subject to a set of internal frictionless contact constraints to prevent material inversion. The efficacy of the proposed modeling framework is investigated through several benchmark dynamic fracture problems run within the explicit finite element code DYNA3D.},

title = {Elasto-Plastic Hourglass Control for Physically Stabilized Non-Linear Finite Elements with Reduced Integration},
author = {Giffin, Brian Doran},
abstract = {A physically stabilized hourglass control scheme is proposed for low-order finite elements with reduced integration, specialized to the case of elasto-plastic material behavior. Conventional hourglass stabilization techniques necessitate an ad hoc reduction of the element's stabilization stiffness parameters to prevent artificially stiff behavior under large plastic deformations. In contrast, the proposed approach circumvents this difficultly by instead enabling plastic deformation in the element's hourglass modes. The method employs an elasto-plastic model order reduction strategy over a given finite element domain to effect a non-linear form of hourglass stabilization, bearing similarity to a resultant plasticity model. Specifically, a mixed discretization of the element's hourglass stress/strain fields is established within a co-rotational frame, and supplemented by a stabilizing plastic strain field to characterize the plastic deformations associated with the hourglass modes. An Lp measure of the hourglass stress field is integrated over the element domain to obtain an element-averaged representation of the stabilizing effective stress. By exploiting the mixed representation of the hourglass stress field, the resulting integrals can be efficiently evaluated without recourse to quadrature. The chosen effective stress measure is then used to generalize an element-based yield criterion, which is designed to inherit the same yield stress and hardening parameters from the constitutive model associated with the element's single integration point. Within this framework, a generalization of the classical radial return algorithm for continuum plasticity is proposed to facilitate a convenient and computationally efficient evolution of the stabilizing plastic strains. The method is formulated to satisfy an element-averaged dissipation inequality, and the resulting stabilization scheme is demonstrated to exhibit energetic consistency. The proposed technique is applied to low-order hexahedral elements, and may be viewed as an elasto-plastic extension of the physically stabilized element formulation introduced by Puso (2000). The efficacy and computational efficiency of the method are explored through a variety of large deformation elasto-plastic problems in explicit dynamics, and compared against conventional hourglass stabilization approaches.

abstract = {A new fully integrated 8-node hexahedral solid finite element is proposed for general use in non-linear quasi-static and dynamic problems. The element formulation is derived from a mixed/enhanced assumed strain principle, where the chosen enhancements for alleviating volumetric and shear locking are treated separately, leading to in- creased computational efficiency, as well as improved stability of the element in quasi-static problems. Nonetheless, for use in highly dynamic problems (such as impact), supplementary stabilization of the element is required. To this end, a novel stabilization strategy is proposed which avoids the use of non-physical parameters, and preserves the locking-free behavior of the element. An efficient implementation of the element is developed for the non-linear finite element code DYNA3D, and a number of example problems are shown to demonstrate the superior accuracy and stability of the element for problems involving highly dynamic processes.

journal={ProQuest Dissertations and Theses},
pages={148},
note={ProQuest},
abstract={This work presents a novel polytopal finite-element framework that addresses the collective issues of discretization sensitivity and mesh generation for computational solid mechanics problems. The use of arbitrary polygonal and polyhedral shapes in place of canonical isoparametric elements seeks to remediate issues pertaining to meshing and mesh quality (particularly for irregularly shaped elements), while maintaining many of the desirable features of a traditional finite element method. A general class of partitioned element methods (PEM) is proposed and analyzed, constituting a family of approaches for constructing piecewise polynomial approximations to harmonic shape functions on arbitrary polytopes. Such methods require a geometric partition of each element, and under certain conditions will directly yield integration consistency. Two partitioned element methods are explored in detail, including a novel approach herein referred to as the discontinuous Galerkin partitioned-element method (DG-PEM). An implementational framework for the DG-PEM is presented, along with a discussion of its associated numerical challenges. The numerical precision of the PEM is explored via classical patch tests and single element tests for a representative sampling of polygonal element shapes. Solution sensitivity with respect to element shape is examined for a handful of problems, including a mesh convergence study in the nearly incompressible regime. Finally, the efficacy of the DG-PEM is assessed for a number of benchmark problems involving large deformations and nonlinear material behavior.},

title = {Improved Partitioned Element Method for Constructing Higher Order Shape Functions on Arbitrary Polyhedra},
author = {Giffin, Brian Doran and Rashid, Mark},
abstract = {We present an improved reformulation of the "partitioned element method'' (PEM): a finite-element-like method in which shape functions are defined on arbitrary polygonal and polyhedral element domains. The method proceeds by partitioning an element into quadrature cells, and allowing the element's shape functions to vary according to a local polynomial defined within each of these cells, resulting in piece-wise polynomial shape functions which are discontinuous at quadrature cell boundaries. The polynomial coefficients defined in each cell are obtained by minimizing a quadratic functional which penalizes discontinuities in the shape functions (and their gradients) across all cell interfaces. Unlike the original method (presented in [1]) which is restricted to piece-wise linear approximants, the present formulation admits polynomials of arbitrary degree, leading directly to higher-order completeness of the shape functions, and improved convergence properties. Numerical results for two- and three-dimensional solid mechanics problems are presented, demonstrating the method's ability to overcome issues pertaining to non-convex elements, geometric degeneracies, and certain forms of element locking phenomena – particularly, those concerning thin elements.

  title        = {Verification of a Convergent Meshless Method in Sierra Solid Mechanics},
  abstract     = {Standard finite-element discretizations in solid mechanics consist of basis functions defined on simple element shapes such as hexahedra. While the use of these standard element shapes is expedient for computational software development, their use in the modeling of extreme deformation processes, such as fracture, pervasive failure, and penetration, is too limiting. Furthermore, the amount of effort required to create hexahedral meshes on geometrically complex shapes is time consuming and thus costly. Several other discretization methods exist for modeling extreme deformation processes, e.g. the nodally integrated Reproducing Kernel Particle Method (RKPM). The primary goal of this project is to implement existing and new RKPM technology into Sierra Solid Mechanics for the modeling of extreme deformation processes including fracture and fragmentation.},
