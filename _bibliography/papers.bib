title = {Shell Element Material Model Verification Problems for DYNA3D: Part II},
author = {Giffin, Brian D.},
abstractNote = {A suite of supplementary shell element material model verification tests were developed for the explicit finite element program DYNA3D, in continuation of the work performed in LLNL-TR-792469 (Shell Element Material Model Verification Problems for DYNA3D). The testing procedure developed in the preceding report is extended, and used to verify all remaining untested shell model features and inputs. A collection of 78 feature-specific verification tests are proposed, some of which are applicable to multiple material models, though many are specialized to a particular model. The collective suite of tests cover all 27 currently available material models in DYNA3D. In the course of developing the proposed test suite, 24 separate shell model-related issues were identified and have subsequently been resolved.},

title = {Verification and large deformation analysis using the reproducing kernel particle method},
author = {Beckwith, Frank},
abstractNote = {The reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM) is a meshless method used to solve general boundary value problems using the principle of virtual work. RKPM corrects the kernel approximation by introducing reproducing conditions which force the method to be complete to arbritrary order polynomials selected by the user. Effort in recent years has led to the implementation of RKPM within the Sierra/SM physics software framework. The purpose of this report is to investigate convergence of RKPM for verification and validation purposes as well as to demonstrate the large deformation capability of RKPM in problems where the finite element method is known to experience difficulty. Results from analyses using RKPM are compared against finite element analysis. A host of issues associated with RKPM are identified and a number of potential improvements are discussed for future work.},
