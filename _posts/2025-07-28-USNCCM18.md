I recently had the opportunity to present at the 18th U.S. National Congress on Computational Mechanics. The focus of my talk was on exactly bit-reversible computational methods for dissipative dynamic systems. You can watch an extended recorded version of my talk on YouTube.

You can also play around with an interactive demonstration (below) of the bit-reversible time integrator discussed in the video.

<canvas id="canvas" oncontextmenu="event.preventDefault()"></canvas>
<script type='text/javascript'>
	document.getElementById( "canvas" ).onwheel = function(event){
    	    event.preventDefault();
	};

	document.getElementById( "canvas" ).onmousewheel = function(event){
    	    event.preventDefault();
	};

	var Module = {
	    canvas: (function() { return document.getElementById('canvas') })()
	};
</script>

You can download the <a href="https://github.com/bdgiffin/remat?tab=readme-ov-file">open-source code</a> from GitHub, and find additional interactive demos in the accompanying documentation for the <a href="https://bdgiffin.github.io/remat/">REMAT bit-REversible physics and MATerial model library</a>.
