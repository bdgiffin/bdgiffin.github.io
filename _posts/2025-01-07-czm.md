CZM is an interactive Cohesive Zone Modeling library designed to run in real time, created primarily for educational purposes.

As a demonstration of the project's core capabilities, an interactive earthquake simulator has been developed which incorporates cohesive failure and dynamic behavior excited by an earthquake ground motion taken from the <a href="https://ngawest2.berkeley.edu">PEER Ground Motion Database</a>. You can download the <a href="https://github.com/bdgiffin/CZM?tab=readme-ov-file">open-source code</a> from GitHub, and experiment with the <a href="https://bdgiffin.github.io/CZM/">playable demo here</a>!
